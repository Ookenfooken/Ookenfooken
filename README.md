- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ookenfooken
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a postdoctoral fellow at Queen's University, interested in eye movements and eye-hand coordination. 
I write most of my experimental and analysis scripts in matlab. 
If you are interested in eye movement analysis code check out Ookenfooken/Shared-eye-movement code.
We have also some useful code to run a dynamic visual acuity test at Ookenfooken/DynamicVisualAcuityExperiment
You can find more info about myself and my work at ookenfooken.github.io
